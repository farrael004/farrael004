### Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

💡 I am experienced in AI development, full-stack product delivery, and technical communication. I design, ship, and scale solutions that save time and create measurable impact.

💬 Here is the project I'm most proud of [Agpal Chat](https://agpal.ca/) (It's the chatbot on the lower-right corner 😉)

⚙️ Some [code](https://github.com/farrael004/simple_chatbot) to display some CI/CD and coding knowledge

A couple other projects I'd like to showcase:

1. [Image deduplication](https://github.com/farrael004/image-deduplication): An open-source python library available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/image-deduplication/) for robust similarity clustering.
2. [Quest](https://github.com/farrael004/Quest): A bit outdated but still a nice way of showing some of my creativity. I created what is essentially a complete RAG system (Something that didn't exist at the time) when people thought the only way to teach LLMs new information was by fine-tunning them.
